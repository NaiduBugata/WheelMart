### **b) System Architecture**

#### **Architectural Diagram**

#### **Explanation of Data Flow**

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** The user journey begins on the **React-based user interface**. Users browse vehicle listings, apply filters, view product details, and initiate actions such as model comparisons, $EMI$ calculations, or test ride bookings. Each action generates an API request to the backend.

2.  **Request Processing (Backend):** The incoming API requests are handled by the **Flask (Python) backend**. It processes the requests, applies business logic, and interacts with the database. For example, the $EMI$ calculator processes input values to return an installment plan, the comparison tool fetches specifications for multiple vehicles, and the booking form securely collects and stores user information.

3.  **Data Persistence (Database):** All application data is stored and managed in a **MongoDB database**. This NoSQL database is optimized for performance and scalability, housing collections for vehicle listings, users, dealers, bookings, and reviews.

4.  **External Service Integration:** The backend integrates with several third-party services to enhance functionality. This includes the **Google Maps API** for showroom locations, **Payment Gateway APIs** for booking fees, and **SMTP/Twilio APIs** for sending email and SMS notifications.

5.  **Response Rendering (Frontend):** The backend sends processed data back to the frontend in **JSON format**. The React UI then dynamically renders this data, presenting a seamless and updated view to the user.
